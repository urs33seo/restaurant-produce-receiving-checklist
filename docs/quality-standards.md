# Produce Receiving Quality Standards (Accept vs. Reject)

Use this guide alongside the **Restaurant Produce Receiving Checklist** to make consistent decisions at receiving, reduce waste, and document issues for credits.

> Tip: When rejecting, take 2–3 quick photos (overall case label + close-up of the issue).

## Quick decision rules

**Accept** when:
- Product matches the invoice (item, pack size, count)
- Temperature-sensitive items feel properly chilled (when applicable)
- No strong off-odors
- No widespread mold, slime, or active decay
- Minor cosmetic issues won’t impact prep or service

**Reject (or request credit)** when:
- Widespread decay/mold/slime in the case
- Strong sour/fermented odors
- Significant bruising/crushing affecting usability
- Leaking juices or wet, broken packaging (cross-contamination risk)
- Incorrect item, count, or pack size vs invoice
- Temperature abuse suspected for sensitive items (soft/wet greens, warm berries, condensation + mush)

## How to document issues (for faster credits)

When you log an issue, include:
- Item + pack size + count
- What’s wrong (use clear terms: mold, slime, split, leakage, odor)
- How widespread (e.g., “6 of 12 clamshells,” “bottom layer affected,” “majority of case”)
- Photos (case label + close-up)
